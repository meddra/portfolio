 ## About me

I'm a detail-oriented individual with a strong desire to start a career as a junior software tester. I recently completed a course in manual QA testing, where I learned the skills needed for this role.

Previously, I worked as a research analyst and CRM administrator. These roles taught me the importance of being thorough and paying attention to detail. I'm good at critical thinking and can analyze situations to find solutions. I hold a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Engineering.

I understand the importance of effective teamwork and open communication in delivering successful projects. I am always eager to learn from others, share knowledge, and contribute to a positive and productive team environment.

My next career goal is to obtain the ISTQB certification and acquire proficiency in API testing.
